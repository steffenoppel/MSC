Review of guidelines for Marine Stewardship Council

Requested by the Marine Stewardship Council to assess the validity of their Performance Indicator guidelines, which included a 'Productivity Analysis' for seabirds. This analysis was very basic and inappropriate, so I developed a better one based on a simple matrix population model adopted from Carneiro et al. 2020.

Repo contains original files sent to me by MSC, R script to conduct analysis, and output.
